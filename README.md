# Order Book
Order Book is a subsystem of an exchange, normally is called the trade engine. 

It is at its initial stage of development at the moment.

## Purpose

- Have a trade engine that can be used by anyone wanting to understand what a trade engine looks like, or simply use it in an exchange system.

## Objective

- Be able to handle large amount of transactions per hour using cheap/affordable off-the-shelf resources.
